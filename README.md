# Omnipresent Yet Overlooked: Heat Kernels in Combinatorial Bayesian Optimization

Our results were obtained by forking two open-source benchmarks: [MCBO](./HEBO/MCBO/README.md) and [NASLIB](./NASLIB/README.md). Both forks contain an updated `README.md` with instructions, and the commit history can be analyzed to understand the modifications made for our paper.
